# Python Knowledge Share
This group formed from a chance encounter between students, tinkerers and enthusiasts at the Edinburgh Tourism Innovation Challenge. During the three days of the hackathon we shared our approaches, tools and tips, and as the weekend came to an end we though we should continue the idea.

Weather you are installing Python for the first time or playing with [capsular neural networks](http://bigthink.com/robby-berman/buh-bye-traditional-neural-networks-hello-capsules), you are welcome to join the group.
