# Datasets
This collection of datasets was originally built by the tutors at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) for their use in the Data Science Immersive Course. Most datasets are .csv files, but the quality of the data should not be assumed (quality of data should _never_ be assumed). From its original state, this repository has been built upon with publicly available datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) and the sources listed below.

We hope to continue building upon this resource.
