3. Manipulations on original CA Department of Public Health data
The data, originally on a per-school basis has been aggregated in the following ways:
- Per public school district (excluding private schools from the count).).
- Private vs. Public school totals
- Per-vaccination type

4. Aggregations
We used U.S. Census and ACS data to retrieve additional information about each school district, for the following variables:

- Children 5-17 in poverty - [Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates](http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/statecounty/data/2012.html)
- Free/Reduced Price Meal Count K-12  - [Student Poverty - FRPM Data](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filessp.asp). In adding this information, we counted only the schools mentioned in the core dataset by California Department of Public Health
- Families with income below poverty level - [National Center for Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sdds/framework/tables.aspx?ds=acsProfile&y=2012)
