Methodology, sources and notes

We used the [2010-2014 lists compiled by Interpol](http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Fugitive-investigations/Operation-Infra-Red/Wanted-persons-Infra-Americas-2013) for the Most Wanted fugitives, and aggregated them with information from:

 Interpol individual PDFs and red notice reports for each criminal. (when available publicly)
Press releases, news articles and mug shots from external databases when official interpol reports weren't public.
In both cases the source of the information is reported in each fugitive's page.

The status of a fugitive (arrested, free, deceased, sentenced..) comes from the lists compiled by Interpol. However in some cases these didn't seem updated with the latest information: therefore for some criminals manually updated the status (the source behind this information is linked to in the fugitive page as well). Should you be aware of more updated information, or should you notice inaccuracies, please let us know.

We made national and regional summaries. Please note that, while the same fugitive could be hiding in multiple countries, he has been counted only once in the regional summaries. (An example: a fugitive possibly hiding in France or Italy would contribute twice to national counts (once for Italy and once for France), but only once for the regional count  (Europe).
